# 🌐 AnniWebsite

> “Started as a school project — will be my base later.”  
> A clean, dark-themed multi-page website made to showcase everything about **Akira** a.k.a **KoiNoYume7**.


## 🚀 Live Website

🎯 **[Visit the site here](https://koinoyume7.github.io/AnniWebsite/)**  
Deployed via GitHub Pages — works on desktop and mobile.


## 📌 What Is This?

AnniWebsite is a personal portfolio built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a pinch of **JavaScript magic** ✨  
It includes:
- About Me
- Technical & Soft Skills
- Cool Projects (with live demo video!)
- Contact section that *actually works*

This isn't just another "school assignment." It's a flex, a playground, and a portfolio all in one.


## 🧭 Pages

- 🔹 [`index.html`](public/index.html) — About Me  
- 🔹 [`abilities.html`](public/abilities.html) — Hard & Soft Skills  
- 🔹 [`portfolio.html`](public/portfolio.html) — Project Showcases  
- 🔹 [`contact.html`](public/contact.html) — Contact Form + Socials

Each page is standalone but shares the same style, animations, and sidebar navigation.


## 🎨 Features

- 🎥 **Embedded YouTube demo** instead of heavy local video files
- 🧠 Responsive design: auto-adapts to mobile (with folding sidebar)
- 🌈 Fancy animations: transitions, scaling effects, and visual polish
- 🔒 Contact form with future plans to integrate Discord DM/Webhook
- 🧩 Modular HTML/CSS layout — perfect for growing the site

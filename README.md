## ✨ Features

- Smooth fade-in and scroll-based animations (AOS)
- Sidebar with active page indicator
- Animated background with subtle movement
- Styled scrollbar that fits the theme
- JavaScript-powered contact form with form validation + message logging
- Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop

## 🧠 Why It Looks Like This

The site uses:
- Box-based layout for structure and clarity
- Gradient background for subtle motion without distraction
- Popout hover effects and soft transitions for a modern feel
- Clean sidebar navigation, highlighted per active page
- Consistent sizing: base 12px font with scaled headers

These decisions reflect a balance between aesthetics, user experience, and performance.

## 🧪 Future Plans

- Full Discord bot integration for form submissions via webhook or bot DM
- Dynamic project portfolio powered by local data
- Theming (light/dark toggle)
- More background effects, particle animations, glitch headers

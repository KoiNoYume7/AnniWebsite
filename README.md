# AnniWebsite

A sleek, personal website project made for school — but designed with **professional best practices** in mind.  
This site introduces the world to **Akira** (also known online as `KoiNoYume7`) and showcases skills, projects, and contact information — all wrapped in a dark, clean aesthetic.

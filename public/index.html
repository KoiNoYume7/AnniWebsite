      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Akira</strong>, just call me <strong>Akira</strong>.<br>
      Most people describe me as unique, strange but loyal and kind. I would also describe myself as unique and interesting. I don't like going to parties, except when artists I respect perform. I can be stubborn and have my own way to do things, but I am open and honest and respect suggestions.</p>
      <p>Now you know quite some things about me :)</p>
